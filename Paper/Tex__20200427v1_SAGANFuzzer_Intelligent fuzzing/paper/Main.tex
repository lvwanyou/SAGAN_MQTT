\begin{abstract}
The Industrial Control Protocol (ICP) is the cornerstone of the communication of the Industrial Control System (ICS). If the security of ICPs can be guaranteed, the security of ICSs can be guaranteed to a large extent. However, the industrial control environment applicable to ICPs has a strong diversity, which causes the meaning of the same parameter in different applications varies greatly. It is difficult for testers to formulate a series of universal security rules. Therefore, fuzz testing (fuzzing) has already become the main method of detecting vulnerabilities in ICPs. It is noticed that the process of fuzzing relies heavily on specifications of ICPs. And it will take a lot of time and manual engineering to analyze and understand specifications. In this paper, we propose a new simple and smart sequence generation neural network framework based on Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP), called HexGANFuzzer, to solve problems. Moreover, we put forward a series of performance metrics to evaluate different models in the field of fuzzing. Compared with traditional methods, our framework can generate massive fake but plausible test protocol messages automatically in a short time without protocol specifications. Compared with other deep learning works for fuzzing, our framework can not only increase the probability of triggering vulnerabilities but also be more parallelizable and require significantly less time to train. We evaluate its performance by testing several typical ICPs, including MQTT and Modbus. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements of HexGANFuzzer on test effectiveness and efficiency: the accuracy that test case packages are generated correctly is 86.08\% and 92.71\% in datasets of different data scales, F-measure reaches 82.08\% and 85.02\%, and the test effectiveness and efficiency are 8.03\% and 5.26\% higher than the WGAN-based model.
